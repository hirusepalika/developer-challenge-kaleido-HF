# ReelRater DApp

_Purpose_: This movie rating application allows users to register and rate 5 newest movies. The app uses blockchain to keep track of secure transactions and not allow users to rate movies multiple times so that final rating results aren't skewed.


## Start Dev environment:
- Run `npm i` to install all necessary packages
- Run `npm start` in both directories called "backend" and "frontend"
